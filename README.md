## Caution

> and edit it to your liking as this repo is for me when i need hop in between various machines
> please do use my configs with care as a ***bricked*** system is something i cannot fix

To clone this repo use the command 
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/lnoxsian/lnox_dot_files
```
If you are here for my sane neovim config copy the nvim/.config/nvim to your config
folder in your system
```bash
apt install neovim # to install neovim or just you know google it
cp -r nvim/.config/nvim ~/.config/;nvim # this copies the config and launches neovim
# the first open may take some time as it has to install all the plugins and compile treesitter
```
And presto now get started coding using neovim as your editor or use it in vscode its your choice ðŸ˜„ 
or if you need my terminal config alacritty and terminator are my daily drivers so.. copy the config and
your off to the races
